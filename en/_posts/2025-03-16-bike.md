After a long search and configuring various bikes with many wishes (and corresponding price tags), the idea of building my own bike slowly took shape. Not just for financial reasons: previous tours at the limit showed that eventually all components wear out. And Murphy's Law says repairs usually strike at the worst moments. So knowing your own bike is a big plus.

## Requirements

Long evenings of research led to a few rough requirements:

- Versatility: gravel, mountain rides, travel, and everyday usability
- More upright seating position, but with drop bars
- Durability and ease of maintenance
- Load capacity for a total weight of 160 kg (bike trailer with kid)

### Frame and Geometry

{% include wide.html img='/assets/img/bike/screenshot_16022025_111738.webp' %}

Everything starts with the frame and geometry, matched to my body size. The material? That was clear for a long time: titanium! Light, extremely durable, and very robust. Near Leipzig, I found a friendly Pinion titanium fan who sold me his NUA Type-A frame. It's designed for the Pinion gearbox and offers enough clearance for tires up to 50 mm wide. The diamond frame is perfect for me because:

- A relatively long wheelbase provides a calm, stable ride → perfect for touring and long distances
- A low bottom bracket drop improves balance, especially at high speeds
- A 73.0° seat tube angle allows for efficient power transfer (positioned over the bottom bracket)
- 435 mm belt line spacing allows for a relatively short belt

### Pinion Drivetrain

The Pinion C1.12i Smart.Shift is a high-quality, electronic gearbox with 12 gears and a 600% gear range, designed for low-maintenance and reliable bikes. I chose the [complete set](https://pinion-bikes.de/PINION-Getriebe-C112i-SmartShift-Komplettset-P5111-TRP-Hywire-Hylex-Road-Scheibenbremse-71-PostMount-81-Forge-175mm-9-mit-Ladekabel-fuer-internen-Akku) with electronic shifting. Although skeptical at first, I was curious about the maintainability and benefits of the technology. The brake-shift levers are from TRP, but only dual-piston, which might be slightly underpowered for the planned 180 mm rotors.

I chose 170 mm cranks, as they’re known to be more knee-friendly on long rides. I also added the speed sensor—originally just for better shift speed, but it turned out the features added a lot more value than expected.

If you say Pinion, you say Gates Carbon Drive. I went with the CDX variant for maximum durability. The front sprocket is 32T (there aren’t many options here), and I chose a 26T rear sprocket. This allows more range in the lower gears and limits the top speed.

### The Wheels

Pinion and DT Swiss hubs are a bit pricier and heavier than comparable DT Swiss 350 models, but they’re robust and durable. I chose tubeless rims rated for up to 180 kg—ideal for luggage and trailers.

I had the front wheel custom built, the rear came pre-assembled. For tires, I went with 45 mm Panaracer Gravelking, which offers better cushioning and off-road performance than my previous 40 mm Schwalbe Allrounds.

The total cost of the bike comes to around **5800 €**, slightly over my 5000 € budget. Comparable bikes cost between 6000–8000 €, so I didn’t save that much considering the time spent.

**Tools & accessories** I ordered for the build:

- PINION Lockring Tool SL
- Motorex Bike Grease 2000
- Stainless steel bolts and thread locker
- TRP brake bleed kit
- Stainless steel L-brackets for rack mounting
- Carbon and copper paste
- Compressor for tubeless setup
- Pipe cutter for the fork
- Headset press tool

## The Assembly

After the frame arrived in beautiful Munich and the ordered parts followed shortly after, the assembly phase began. Goal: finish during the return window.

{% include gallery.html album='ga01' %}

The rear wheel is installed first to adjust the speed sensor. I crafted a mount from an aluminum block—drilling, sawing, filing... forgotten skills!

{% include gallery.html album='ga03' %}

I decided on an external battery and wiring mount for easier maintenance. I used a sealed coffee can and zip-tied it to the bottle cage mount. Lightweight, stable, and easy to detach.

{% include gallery.html album='ga04' %}

Installing the large brake rotors with adapters took patience. The lower adapter required custom bolts, which I filed and drilled myself.

{% include gallery.html album='ga05' %}

After a long wait, the recommended water-repellent grease finally arrived. I closed the gearbox and mounted cranks, sprockets, and belt. Later, I added some used flip pedals.

The fork installation only worked on the second attempt—I damaged the lower bearing seal. I don’t recommend using a rubber mallet. I had to file off some paint from the steerer with a pipe. After that, everything up to the cockpit went smoothly. I added 40 mm spacers and left the steerer tube longer just in case. The +14° stem is more relaxed than sporty—for now.

{% include gallery.html album='ga07' %}

We bled the brakes five times before they were bubble-free. I’ve never seen air trapped in shift levers before… Final stretch! The rack is adjusted using two angle brackets for a flat fit—I didn’t like a slanted look.

{% include gallery.html album='ga08' %}

After mounting my old saddle and securing all the bolts, it was ready. A first nervous test ride cleared all doubts. The next day, I added the bar tape and went on a longer ride. Compared to my previous bike:

- Shift automation while idle is a dream
- Riding position and handlebar setup are super comfortable
- Wheels feel stable on-road and off-road
- Handling and traction are very confidence-inspiring
- Weight distribution is excellent—even allows jumps
- Gearbox is breaking in and shifting precisely
- Brakes still need to bed in
- The titanium and carbon damping is clearly noticeable

Want more? Absolutely!

### Addendum after the first two tours (and planning for Denmark):

- I might switch the cockpit to carbon in the long run (the flex is amazing)
- The fork will likely be titanium or carbon later once I find a good used one
- The used seatpost is slightly too narrow in diameter (typical carbon tolerance)
- TRP levers rattle a bit off-road, which I fixed with some tape at the pivot
- To better distribute weight (no more strapped-on dry bag), I’m adding small fork bags and possibly larger saddle bags in the rear
